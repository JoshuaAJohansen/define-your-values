# define-your-values
This repo is a fork from codesandbox-https://codesandbox.io/s/draggable-list-vp020

In Tony Robbin's book Unlimited Power he explains that complex systems must be congruent for them to work at a peak level. If actions aren't in alignment with values then a person will not be totally happy or fulfilled. To find out your hierarchy of values start with the first value, and ask for each value beneath it if anything is more important than this. Once you have finished that value, move on to the next. You can update the list accordingly as you find additional values that are important to you, or remove those that don't serve you.

### Values from Unlimited Power:
* Love
* Ecstasy
* Mutual communication
* Respect
* Fun
* Growth
* Support
* Challenge
* Creativity
* Beauty
* Attraction
* Spiritual unity
* Freedom
* Honest

To change the values listed in the draggable list you can do so at the bottom of 'index.js'.
`render(<DraggableList items={'Love,Ecstasy,Mutual communication, Respect, Fun, Growth, Support, Challenge, Creativity, Beauty, Attraction, Spiritual Unity, Freedom, Honesty'.split(',')} />, document.getElementById('root'))`
The values are comma separated. The other change I made to the additional repo is to remove the colors from the styles.css so that all the values are the same color, and that won't affect your opinion of a value.

Cheers to congruency!
